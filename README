How To Play
-----------------

You are a soldier but you refuse to kill.

You are sent against an army of enemies as a scout unit.

Dislocate as many enemies as possible, break their formations and your main army will finish them off. 

Stun them, boost their speed, collect resources and carve your way through hordes of enemies.
